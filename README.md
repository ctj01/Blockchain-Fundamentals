## What is a Blockchain 
Blockchain technology is a decentralized and distributed ledger system that allows multiple participants to maintain and update a shared database without the need for a central authority. It consists of a chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions or data. One key difference from a traditional database is that blockchain employs cryptographic techniques to ensure the immutability and integrity of the data. Additionally, blockchain enables trust and transparency by allowing participants to validate and verify transactions independently, removing the need for intermediaries.
## What is a Bitcoin
The Bitcoin system, unlike traditional banking and payment systems, does not require trust in third parties. Instead of a central trusted authority, in Bitcoin, each user can use software running on their own computer to verify the correct operation of every
aspect of the Bitcoin system.
The Bitcoin system consists of users with wallets containing keys, transactions that are propagated across the network, and miners who produce (through competitive computation) the consensus blockchain, which is the authoritative journal of all transactions.
## What is a Ethereum
Ethereum is a network of computers all over the world that follow a set of rules called the Ethereum protocol. The Ethereum network acts as the foundation for communities, applications, organizations and digital assets that anyone can build and use.
You can create an Ethereum account from anywhere, at any time, and explore a world of apps or build your own. The core innovation is that you can do all this without trusting a central authority that could change the rules or restrict your access.
