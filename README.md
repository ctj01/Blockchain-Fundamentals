## What is a Blockchain 
Blockchain technology is a decentralized and distributed ledger system that allows multiple participants to maintain and update a shared database without the need for a central authority. It consists of a chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions or data. One key difference from a traditional database is that blockchain employs cryptographic techniques to ensure the immutability and integrity of the data. Additionally, blockchain enables trust and transparency by allowing participants to validate and verify transactions independently, removing the need for intermediaries.
